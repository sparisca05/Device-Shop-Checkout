# Device Shop Checkout

This is a personal-project developed for a challenge in devchallenges.io

The idea was to replicate a template that they provided me with these requirements:

- Build an Apple shop checkout page website with a top navigation, summary section and contact form section.

- Use fundamental CSS techniques like Grid and Flexbox to structure the layout.

- Display all the products in the summary section.

- Collect user information such as name, email, and country in the contact section.

- Style the layout to be responsive and adapt to different screen sizes.

- Practice styling forms and fundamental CSS techniques like Grid and Flex.

- Ensure the website is accesible and user-friendly.

- Test the website on different devices and screen sizes to ensure responsiveness.

- Optimize the website for performance and loading speed.

- Use semantic HTML for performance and loading speed.

- Aply CSS styles to enhance the visual presentation of hte Apple shop checkout page elements.

- Validate the HTML and CSS code to ensure it follows best practices and standards.

- (Optional) Add hover effects or animations to make the website more interactive.

- Document the code and provide clear instructions on how to run and use the website.

- Deploy the website to make it accesible for everyone.

## Running the code

Run:

- npm i

Now you can use the website.
